# CSV-to-XML
This is a small python script that reads a CSV file and writes an XML file with the same data in it.
# Why-XML?
XML has several benefits including human readability, validation (DTDs), and a large amount of already existing libraries to work with it
# future improvements
I would like to add in the future, the ability to read array data seperated using a vertical pipe and an ability to link to a DTD for validation.
